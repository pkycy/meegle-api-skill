# Meegle API — Comments

Comment-related OpenAPIs (e.g. add, list, update comments on work items). Use when you need to create or query comments.

**Prerequisites:** Obtain domain and access token first; see skill **meegle-api-users** for domain, plugin_access_token / user_access_token, and request headers.

## APIs (to be documented)

- Create comment, list comments, update/delete comment, and related endpoints will be documented here.
