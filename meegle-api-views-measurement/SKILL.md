Views, boards, and measurement related OpenAPIs (e.g. get view detail, list views, metrics, charts). Use when you need to query or manage views or measurement data.

**Prerequisites:** Obtain domain and access token first; see skill **meegle-api-users** for domain, plugin_access_token / user_access_token, and request headers.

## APIs (to be documented)

- Get view detail, list views, get view work items, measurement/chart APIs, and related endpoints will be documented here.
